# CarDekho-Price-prediction-machine-learning

A model to predict the price of a used car.

A model to predict the price of a used car should be developed in order to assess its value based on a variety of characteristics. Several factors affect the price of a used car, such as company, model, year, transmission, distance driven, fuel type, seller type, and owner type. As a result, it is crucial to know the car's actual market value before purchasing or selling it..

## Description:

This project investigates the influence of various factors on car prices, enabling predictions based on:

* Company: Manufacturer/brand (e.g., Toyota, Honda)
* Model: Specific car variant (e.g., Camry, Civic)
* Year: Production year
* Transmission: Gearbox type (e.g., Automatic, Manual)
* Distance Driven: Total mileage
* Fuel Type: Gasoline, Diesel, Hybrid, Electric, etc.
* Seller Type: Individual, Dealership, Auction, etc.
* Owner Type: First Owner, Second Owner,

## Dataset:

* Source: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/harsha012001/cardekho-price-prediction)
* Size: number of data points = 4340, features= 8
* Preprocessing steps: missing value imputation, statastical analysis)

## Methodology:

* Analysed the data for statastical Analysis, Missing Values, Correlational analysis.
* Split the data into training and testing dataset and further applied normalization.
* Used Linear Regression algorithm for prediction.
* Evaluated models using R square score with value of 0.49.
